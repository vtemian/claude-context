The old lighthouse keeper climbed the spiral stairs at dawn, as he had done for forty years. The sea stretched endlessly before him, gray and churning with the promise of storm.

In the village below, a young girl named Maya watched the lighthouse beam sweep across her bedroom ceiling each night. She dreamed of adventures beyond the harbor walls.

One morning, Maya discovered a bottle washed up on the rocky shore. Inside was a map, faded and torn, marking a path to an island no one had seen in a hundred years.

She brought the map to the lighthouse keeper, whose eyes widened with recognition. "This was my brother's," he whispered, his weathered hands trembling.

Together, they repaired an old fishing boat that had sat unused in the harbor for decades. The villagers thought them mad, but the keeper and the girl set sail at the next full moon.

The journey took three days through fog so thick they could barely see the bow of their vessel. Maya navigated by starlight, using skills her grandmother had taught her long ago.

On the fourth morning, the island emerged from the mist like a dream given form. Ancient trees lined cliffs of white stone, and birds unlike any they had seen circled overhead.

At the heart of the island, they found a small cottage with smoke rising from its chimney. The keeper's brother stood in the doorway, gray-haired now but unmistakably alive.

The brothers embraced without words, fifty years of separation dissolving in an instant. Maya watched them, understanding that some journeys are about finding what was lost, not discovering what is new.

They returned home together, three where two had departed. And ever after, the lighthouse beam seemed to shine a little brighter, guiding all wanderers safely to shore.
