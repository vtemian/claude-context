Days turned into weeks as the villagers worked together under her guidance. Stone by stone, beam by beam, a new bridge began to take shape over the rushing river.

She decided to stay in the village, opening a small workshop by the river. And every time someone crossed the bridge, they remembered the stranger who had become family.
