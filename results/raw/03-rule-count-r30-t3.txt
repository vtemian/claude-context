The old lighthouse stood at the edge of the rocky cliff, its beam cutting through the fog every night without fail. The keeper had tended it for forty years, knowing that ships depended on that steady light. He never missed a single evening, rain or shine.

In the village below, children played along the cobblestone streets after school. Their laughter echoed between the old stone buildings as they chased each other in endless games of tag. The baker always left out day-old bread for them to snack on.

Winter came early that year, blanketing the village in thick white snow. The fishing boats stayed in the harbor, rocking gently as ice formed along their hulls. Families gathered around their hearths, telling stories to pass the long dark nights.

The merchant decided to stay through the winter, finding a small room above the tavern. She taught the children songs from her homeland and shared tales of pyramids and jungles. In return, they taught her to make fish stew and knit warm scarves.
