The sun rose over the quiet village, casting golden light across the cobblestone streets. A baker named Elena opened her shop, filling the air with the warm scent of fresh bread. Birds gathered on her windowsill, hoping for crumbs.

A stranger walked into the bakery wearing a long travel cloak. He asked for directions to the old lighthouse on the cliff. Elena noticed a mysterious map tucked under his arm.

The lighthouse had stood abandoned for thirty years since its keeper vanished. Locals whispered about strange lights that still flickered from its tower on stormy nights. No one dared investigate.

Elena closed her shop early that afternoon, her mind racing with questions. She followed the cliff path toward the lighthouse, her heart pounding with each step. The stranger's silhouette appeared ahead at the rusted gate.

Together they pushed open the heavy door and climbed the spiral staircase. Dust motes danced in shafts of light from cracked windows. At the top, they found a room filled with journals and strange instruments.

The stranger revealed he was the grandson of the missing lighthouse keeper. His grandfather had been an inventor, and the map led to his greatest creation. Hidden beneath the floorboards lay a device that could harness the power of starlight.

The device could bring light to the entire village, but it needed someone to tend it. The stranger couldn't stay, as his travels called him elsewhere. He asked Elena if she would become the new keeper.

Elena thought of her quiet life baking bread each morning. This was a chance for something greater, a way to serve her village in a new light. She accepted the role with determination in her eyes.

That night, Elena activated the starlight device for the first time. Brilliant light poured from the lighthouse, illuminating every corner of the village below. Children ran outside, pointing at the sky in wonder.

Elena still baked bread in the mornings, but her evenings belonged to the lighthouse. The village prospered under her care, and sailors far at sea found their way home safely. She had found her true calling where bread and starlight met.
