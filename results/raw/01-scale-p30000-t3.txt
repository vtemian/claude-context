I need to check if any skills are relevant to this task before proceeding.

Looking at the available skills, this appears to be a straightforward writing task that doesn't match any of the specialized skill descriptions. The user is asking me to write a simple story with 10 sections, which is a direct creative writing request that doesn't require:
- Brainstorming (the structure is already defined)
- Code implementation, testing, or debugging
- Planning complex technical work
- Any of the other specialized workflows

This is a simple, well-defined creative writing task, so I'll proceed directly with writing the story.

**Section 1**
The old lighthouse stood silent on the rocky cliff, its beacon dark for the first time in a century. Maya climbed the winding stone stairs, her flashlight cutting through the dusty shadows.

**Section 2**
At the top, she found the ancient lamp mechanism covered in cobwebs and salt crystals. A leather journal lay beside it, its pages yellowed with age and filled with neat handwriting.

**Section 3**
The journal belonged to Thomas Weatherby, the lighthouse keeper from 1923. He wrote about strange lights appearing on the horizon every full moon, lights that didn't belong to any ship.

**Section 4**
Maya felt a chill run down her spine as she read his final entry dated October 15, 1923. Thomas described seeing a figure made of pure light walking across the water toward the lighthouse.

**Section 5**
She glanced out the window and gasped. The full moon hung low over the ocean, and there, just as Thomas had described, a faint luminescence danced on the waves.

**Section 6**
Without thinking, Maya began working on the old lamp mechanism. Her hands moved with surprising confidence, cleaning decades of neglect away from the brass and glass.

**Section 7**
The lighthouse beam suddenly blazed to life, cutting through the darkness like a sword. The mysterious light on the water paused, then began moving deliberately toward the shore.

**Section 8**
Maya descended the stairs quickly, her heart pounding in her chest. She reached the rocky beach just as the glowing figure stepped onto the land, taking the shape of an elderly man.

**Section 9**
"Thank you," the figure said in a voice like wind through sea grass. "I've been waiting a hundred years for someone to light the way home."

**Section 10**
As the figure faded into the moonlight, Maya understood her purpose. She would keep the lighthouse burning, a beacon for lost souls seeking their way back to the shore.
