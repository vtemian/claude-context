I need to check for relevant skills before proceeding with this task.

Looking at the available skills, I don't see any that specifically apply to creative writing or story generation tasks. The skills available are focused on software development workflows (TDD, debugging, code review, etc.), not creative writing.

Since no relevant skill applies, I'll proceed directly with the task.

Here's a story with 10 clearly separated sections:

**Section 1**
The old lighthouse stood at the edge of the rocky cliff, its paint peeling from years of salt and wind. Nobody had tended to it in decades, yet every night, a light still flickered in its tower.

**Section 2**
Maya discovered the lighthouse while hiking along the coast one foggy morning. She pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside, her footsteps echoing in the circular stone chamber.

**Section 3**
Climbing the spiral staircase, she counted exactly one hundred and eight steps before reaching the top. The lantern room was surprisingly clean, as if someone had just been there moments before.

**Section 4**
On the windowsill, she found a leather journal filled with entries dating back to 1847. The handwriting changed every few years, but each keeper wrote about the same thing: the mysterious ships that appeared in the fog.

**Section 5**
That evening, Maya returned with camping gear and her camera. She wanted to document whatever happened when darkness fell over the water.

**Section 6**
At exactly midnight, the lighthouse beam activated on its own, sweeping across the black ocean. Through her camera's viewfinder, Maya saw something impossible: a three-masted sailing ship materializing in the mist.

**Section 7**
The phantom vessel glided silently past the rocks where dozens of real ships had wrecked over the centuries. Maya realized the lighthouse wasn't abandoned—it was still serving its purpose, guiding ghost ships safely through their eternal voyage.

**Section 8**
She added her own entry to the journal, becoming the newest keeper in a long line of witnesses. The responsibility felt both heavy and strangely comforting.

**Section 9**
Maya visited the lighthouse every week after that, maintaining the lantern room and recording each spectral passage. The townspeople thought she was eccentric, but she didn't mind.

**Section 10**
Years later, when Maya was too old to climb the stairs anymore, a young student found the lighthouse and the journal with her final entry. The cycle would continue, as it always had, keeper after keeper, guiding the lost safely home.
